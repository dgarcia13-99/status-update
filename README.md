# PalTrack

PalTrack is the first web application I created! It allows users to post their current status, view others' latest updates, and track status history. It's a simple and fun way to stay connected with friends.

## How to Use

1. Open your terminal.  
2. Navigate to the folder where this application is stored.  
3. Run the script using Python:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
